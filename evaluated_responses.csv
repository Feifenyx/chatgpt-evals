695bf3cc-69d8-8348-9388-172993aab4ce,Econs Skills Over IQ,40 no chio liao lah.,"😅 I hear you. **“40 no chio liao”** = feeling damn sian already.

But let me pause you there — **40 does NOT mean game over**. More importantly, we need to **diagnose the economics**, not the emotion.

Let me coach you through this properly.

---

## First: reset the thinking (important)
Getting ~40 usually tells me **not that you don’t know Economics**, but that:
- your **analysis chains are incomplete**, or  
- your **question requirements (R1 / R2 / EV)** were not clearly met, or  
- you’re **describing instead of explaining cause → effect → outcome**.

These are **skills problems**, not IQ problems. Skills can be fixed.

---

## Now, I need *your thinking* 👇 (don’t skip this)
Tell me **one** of the following (you choose):

1️⃣ **Essay or Case Study?**  
2️⃣ **Which topic?** (e.g. market failure, inflation, firms, macro policies)  
3️⃣ **What do you think went wrong?**  
   - “I don’t know what to write”
   - “I wrote a lot but still low”
   - “Teacher say no analysis / weak eval”

👉 Just answer briefly. No need long story.

---

## While waiting, let me already challenge one key misconception
Many students think:
> “Marks low = content weak”

But in H2 Econs, **content is only the entry ticket**.

Markers are asking:
- Did you **identify the correct economic mechanism**?
- Did you **link step-by-step** (why → how → so what)?
- Did you **answer the question set**, not the one in your head?

Example:
- ❌ “Tax reduces consumption”
- ✅ “Tax raises price → quantity demanded falls due to law of demand → allocative inefficiency reduced if overconsumption existed”

Same content. Very different marks.

---

## Hard truth (but encouraging one)
If you were truly hopeless, you’d be at **20–25**, not 40.

40 = **there is structure somewhere**, just not tight enough.

That means:
- we **tighten PEEL**
- we **fix R1/R2 targeting**
- we **train evaluation judgement**

One by one. Not everything at once.

---

## Your turn (must answer)
Reply with:
> **“Essay / CS, topic = ___, I think problem is ___.”**

We’ll fix **one paragraph** first. Not whole script.  
That’s how marks move. 💪",g-68edb60821dc81cc8c87afc4bbfca9a8,unknown,True,0,True,True,1767633870.105768
695bf4ea-5c00-834b-9419-fa49c459d14e,Chio Liao,40 no chio liao lah.,"😅 I hear you. Sounds like you’re feeling **demoralised** — “40 already no hope” kind of mood.

But let me check something with you first (important mindset shift as an Econ student 👇):  
👉 **What does “40” actually mean here?**  
- 40/100 for a paper?  
- 40/60 for CSQ?  
- Or 40 for one essay section?

In Economics, **one bad outcome ≠ no way to improve**, because marks are not random — they come from **very specific skills** (R1/R2 analysis, use of tools, evaluation).

Let’s be very concrete and Econ-focused.

### Coach talk (firm but fair)
If you’re stuck around 40, it usually means **Cursory (C) or Knowledge (K)** level, not that you “cannot do Econ”. Most common issues:
- Explaining *what* but not *why* (weak causal links)
- Diagram present but **not used analytically**
- No clear **R1 / R2 separation**
- Evaluation = opinion, not synthesis

All of these are **fixable**.

### Quick diagnostic (answer honestly)
Which one sounds most like you right now?
1. “I know content but cannot link properly”
2. “I don’t know what the question wants”
3. “My evaluation always kena kill”
4. “CSQ okay, essay GG”
5. “Diagrams I anyhow draw”

Reply with the **number** only.  
We’ll fix **one thing at a time** — that’s how Econ marks actually move up 📈",g-68edb60821dc81cc8c87afc4bbfca9a8,unknown,True,0,True,True,1767634155.724939
